## Phase 3: Impact Assessment & User Analysis

### Updates

<< Analysis of potential impact on the Stalwart deployments >>

Based on telemetry data and version statistics, approximately X installations may be affected.

### Tasks

- [ ] Analyze version adoption from update checks (if available)
- [ ] Estimate number of vulnerable installations
- [ ] Assess if default configurations are vulnerable
- [ ] Review if vulnerability has been exploited (check logs, reports)
- [ ] Determine if any user data may have been compromised
- [ ] Check for indicators of active exploitation in the wild

### Analysis Notes

_Document your impact assessment process and findings_
